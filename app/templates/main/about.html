            Screenshot to Code is an AI-powered tool that transforms UI screenshots into clean, production-ready code in seconds.

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Our Mission</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700">
            We believe developers should focus on building great products, not recreating existing UIs from scratch. 
            Our mission is to accelerate development by automating the tedious process of converting designs to code.
        </p>
        
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">How It Works</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700">
            Using advanced AI models like GPT-4 Vision and Claude 3.5 Sonnet, we analyze your UI screenshots and generate 
            semantically correct, well-structured code that follows best practices. The result is production-ready code 
            that you can use immediately in your projects.
        </p>
